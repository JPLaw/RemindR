## Introduction:
`RemindR <https://remindr-midterm.herokuapp.com/>`_  is an application that simply reminds you that you have something to do. A SMS message will be sent to your phone to let you know when an event is ready. Some examples include but are not limited to a pill that needs to be taken or you and a group of friends that need to make sure you follow through or just simply give your mom a remindR that you're hungry and need food.
