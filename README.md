## Introduction:
`RemindR <https://remindr-midterm.herokuapp.com/>`_  is an application that simply reminds you or someone you know that you have something to do. An SMS message will be sent to your phone to let you know when an event is ready or when a task needs to be accomplished. Simply enter a time, a valid phone number, and remind someone that they have something they need to finish! When they have accomplished the task at hand or acknowledged the reminder, you will get a message on YOUR phone that the task has been completed.
